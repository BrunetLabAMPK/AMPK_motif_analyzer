#
# ================ DESCRIPTION =====================
#
# This script scores any given phosphorylation motifs based on how well they match the AMPK phosphorylation 
# motif. The higher the score, the better. Each motif of interest is scored by summing the log10 of the 
# standardized AMPK motif frequencies (see "frequency file" below).
#
# ================= HOW TO RUN =====================

# Required files:
#
# (1) frequency file:  AMPK_motif_109_standardized_log10.txt contains the log10 of (frequencies of amino 
#                      acids in the AMPK motifs of 109 AMPK phosphorylation sites from N5 to C4 divided 
#                      by the average frequency of that amino acid at that location in 10,000 matched 
#                      background datasets of human phosphorylation sites
# (2) Input file:      Any tab delimited text file of the user's choosing that contains the phosphorylation 
#                      motif(s) of interest in the first column. Each motif must only be from the N terminal
#					   5 to the C terminal 4 positions, including the phosphorylated residue.
#					   The remaining columns will be ignored. The file should not contain a header row.
# Output:
# A file, with the motif score added in the final column. User must provide the name of this file on terminal.
#
# To run type the following command in the termninal:
# perl Rank_AMPK_Motifs.pl --frequency AMPK_motif_109_standardized_log10.txt --input Example_input.txt --output Example_input_scored.txt
#
# --frequency  is the AMPK motif file provided with the script
# --input      is the file having motifs to be scored
# --output     is the output file with scored motifs
