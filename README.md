AMPK Motif Analyzer
===================

Uses a position weight matrix to calculate a distance score for input motifs based on how closely they match the AMPK motif. Position weight matrix was generated by taking the log10 of the (frequency of each amino acid from N terminal 5 to C terminal 4 in the AMPK motif of 109 known AMPK substrates divided by a background frequency calculated by taking the average amino acid occurrence at each matching position in 10,000 matched background datasets containing human phosphoserines and threonines). The higher the score, the closer the motif to the AMPK motif.

Lowest motif score allowed for high confidence: 1.016513 (the mean minus one standard deviation of the 109 known AMPK substrates when scored with this algorithm).
